              As a young, global fashion brand, we believe it is our duty to
              take care of the planet, not only for own sake, but for all future
              generations to come. So far, we’ve launched various initiatives to
              keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making
              conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the
              communities in the countries, in which we operate. You can read

            <br />
            <p>
              SILFEN made a concious choice to only use either eco-friendly or
              organic cotton for our bags. This means that there’s no use of the
              toxic chemicals that are used in conventional cotton production -
              and therefore no poisoning of the water. Furthermore, studies
              show, that using organic cotton for your production saves around 1
              gallon of water per production compared to traditional cotton
              production Every nylon product is made from eco-friendly material,
              meaning that the journey from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts
              the environment as little as possible.
