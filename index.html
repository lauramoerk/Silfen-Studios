            <p>As a young, global fashion brand,  we believe it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
                So far, we’ve launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we operate.
                You can read about the specific initiatives below:

        <h2>Organic Cotton</h2>
        <br>
        <p>SILFEN made a concious choice to only use either eco-friendly or organic cotton for our bags. This means that there’s no use of the toxic chemicals that are used in conventional cotton production - and therefore no poisoning of the water. 
            Furthermore, studies show, that using organic cotton for your production saves around 1 gallon of water per production compared to traditional cotton production
            
            Every nylon product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.</p>

    <p>Some of the SILFEN  bags are made out of leather goods.

        All of out leather is made from  bi-products of the food industry. 
        
        This means  that every part of the animal is utilized in various industries. </p>

    <h2>rPET</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. 

        The material is well known as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. 
        
        With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution irresponsible wasting. 
        
        We wish to pass this awareness to our customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!</p>

            In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new

            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world.
